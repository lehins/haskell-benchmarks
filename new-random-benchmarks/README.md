# random-benchmarks

This package includes benchmarks for available libraries in Haskell for random number
generation. Here is the corresponding blog post: [Random
Benchmarks](https://alexey.kuleshevi.ch/blog/2019/12/21/random-benchmarks/), which besides
introduction to those libraries, includes the results of these benchmarks.
